     PART2
     Before reading this go bellow and read PART1 in order to understand this
     In order to take the data I saved in my memory I had first to create a UseresDefault as I did for saving the data.
     Then, in general (basically in order parts of the code in other views this will be more used) I assign a instance created (before or in that moment depending in what I want) to the object saved in the proper address I chose for it

    //nothing to display because it is the first time it is installed in the device

     PART 1
     
     Here is the first time I use a programming technique I used all over my code
     I got the inspiration from
     This technique basically stores some object in the memory, string, integers,floats etc
     Therefore, if the user closes the app when he opens it again he will still have his scores, days names or anything stored back
    
     I will explain here the technique so that then I will refer to this point in case you need to know how did I store and share my data between tab bars
    
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     First I created a UserDefaults instance.This class helps the programmer to save data in the device. Then I set my instance with a standarduserdefaults method
     Afterwards, I assign the desired data I want to save(in this case called save) to an adress. I dont really know if this will be a memory address(I guess so) but it will basically create a path in the same way addresses work.
     Then I had to sinchronise my usersdefault instance
     Now I have saved the instance or object I wanted into the device memory.
     In case I want to use it in another view or another part of the code I would have to take that data from the memory. This is explained above in the part 2.

    self.NameLabel.text=[NSString stringWithFormat:@"Welcome %@",save];
    //If save button is pressed the name written will be saved
}





- (IBAction)removekeyboard:(id)sender {   //if any part of the screen is pressed the keyboard that appeared for writingn the text field will dissapear.

    // method for making that
    //everytime the retun button of the keyboard is pressed it will dissapear.
