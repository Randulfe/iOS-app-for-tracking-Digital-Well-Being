# iOS app project for managing the Digital Well Beign status

App created as an uni project back in 2016 with the aim to improve people's lifes by managing their daily performance with phone addiction, walking instead of driving, waking up on time and so on. 

This was one of my first projects and therefore, both the coding and design are very very very far from good. XD
This was built using X-Code as back in 2016 Swift was the new thing around and the module had a clear preference for older languages.
